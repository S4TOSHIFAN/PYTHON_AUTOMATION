FUTURE JOBS LIST FOR PRACTICE.
MODULAR PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT. 
If you want to build a library of functions in Python, you might consider working on the following projects:

String manipulation functions: Write functions for tasks such as reverse a string, find the length of a string, and convert a string to uppercase or lowercase.

Mathematical functions: Implement functions for performing mathematical operations such as finding the factorial of a number, calculating the Fibonacci sequence, and solving linear equations.

File handling functions: Write functions for reading and writing files, such as reading a CSV file and writing its content to a new file in a different format.

Image processing functions: Develop functions for basic image processing tasks, such as resizing an image, converting an image to grayscale, and applying filters to an image.

Web scraping functions: Create functions for scraping data from websites, such as extracting information from HTML pages and converting it into a usable format.

Data analysis functions: Build functions for analyzing data, such as calculating statistics (mean, median, standard deviation), visualizing data with graphs, and clustering data.

These projects will help you build a diverse set of functions that can be used in a variety of applications and serve as a foundation for more complex projects in the future.
